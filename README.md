67. **RAFT** - Raft is a consensus algorithm.
  Use Cases Of Raft:
  - CockroachDB - used in replication layer
  - etcd 
  - replicated log - Provides append-only storage of log entries(new data can be appended to the storage, but where existing data is immutable)
    
68. **Hyperscale** - Hyperscale is a computing architecture that can scale as demand increases. Hyperscale cloud computing is a multi-tenant platform that allows users to access computing resources on-demand. These resources are available globally over the internet, enabling users to provision and scale resources instantly.
    
69. **Protobuf** - Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source data format developed by Google. It's used to serialize structured data for storage and communication over a network. Protobuf is great for the following reasons:   

- Low data volume
- Persistence
- Backward-compatible serialization

70. **KubeVirt** -KubeVirt is an open-source add-on for Kubernetes that allows virtual machines (VMs) to run on Kubernetes. KubeVirt is designed to help development teams that want to use Kubernetes but have workloads that can't be easily containerized.

  KubeVirt allows you to: 
- Provision, manage, and control VMs simultaneously with container resources
- Integrate with existing Kubernetes deployments seamlessly
- Run VMs within regular Kubernetes pods
- Access standard pod networking and storage
- Manage VMs using standard Kubernetes tools such as kubectl
- Run full virtual machines on Kubernetes alongside regular containers
71. **Libvert** - Open SOurce developed by Redhat to manage virtualization. It can be used to manage
  - KVM - Open Source Hypervisor for Linux
  - XEN - Type I Hypervisor currently developed by Linux Foundation
  - ESXi (From VMware)

It consists of :
- A long term stable C API
- A daemon (libvirtd)
- A command line utility (virsh)
  
72. **PAT** - Port Address Translation (PAT) is a network device feature that translates TCP or UDP communications between hosts on a private network and hosts on a public network. PAT allows a single public IP address to be used by many hosts on the private network. PAT works by: 
- Assigning each device a unique port number.
- Routing incoming traffic accordingly.

73. **IaC** - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a DevOps practice that uses code to manage and provision infrastructure. It allows developers and operations teams to automatically manage and provision infrastructure through code.  

74. **HCL** - HCL stands for HashiCorp Configuration Language. It's a configuration language that's designed to be both human and machine-readable. It's used in infrastructure automation to help developers write and deploy cloud resources across multiple platforms.
